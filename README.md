A system that focuses on the creating of timetables for a university by scheduling courses with their modules and classes. 
The system allows the user to set various constraints and optimisation options on the schedule which are taken into account when the Scheduling Engine operates. 
The engine uses an intelligent algorithm to ensure the modifications and constraints are applied and followed while completing the schedule efficiently. 
Also, the system allows the user to manage the data of the university's various entities and facilitates the user to access the system as a student or lecturer to perform tasks specific to them.
